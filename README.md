### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Frederik Kratzert, Researcher @ Google working in the Flood Forecasting Team. This here is my private GitHub account, were I maintain my open source projects and publish code related to any kind of research articles.

Most of my research is dedicated towards solving applications in environmental sciences (mainly hydrology) with machine learning.
